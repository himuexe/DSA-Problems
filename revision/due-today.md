## üìù Quick Actions

### For Tomorrow's Reviews
1. **Review Process:**
   - Cover solution section and try to recall approach
   - Explain in 2 minutes - can you teach it to someone?
   - Mark success level: Easy recall / Some struggle / Need to re-solve
   - Schedule next review: 3 days if easy, 1 day if struggling

2. **Time Management for 185 Minutes (3 hours 5 minutes):**
   - **Option 1:** Single focused session with breaks
   - **Option 2:** Split into morning (95 min AC) + afternoon (50 min Kunal Arrays) + evening (40 min Searching)
   - **Option 3:** Topic-based sessions throughout the day

3. **Priority Order:** 
   - Start with familiar (Arrays basics)
   - Progress to challenging (Trapping Rain Water, Advanced Binary Search)
   - End with new concepts (Searching algorithms)
