## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t` where `t` is generated by randomly shuffling the letters of `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. Find the letter that was added in `t`.

## Intuition/Approach
Use XOR bit manipulation to find the difference. XOR of identical characters cancels out (returns 0), leaving only the extra character. This works because XOR is commutative and associative.

## Key Observations
- XOR of identical characters equals 0: `a ^ a = 0`
- XOR with 0 returns the original character: `a ^ 0 = a`
- Order doesn't matter in XOR: `a ^ b ^ c = c ^ a ^ b`
- All characters in `s` appear in `t`, so they cancel out
- Only the extra character remains after XOR operations

## Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize result = 0 (neutral element for XOR)
2. XOR all characters in string `s` with result
3. XOR all characters in string `t` with result
4. Return result (the extra character)

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through both strings
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - only using one variable for result
- **Justification:** Linear scan with constant space bit manipulation

## Edge Cases Considered
- [x] Empty string s (t has single character)
- [x] Single character strings
- [x] All same characters with one extra
- [x] Different character types (uppercase, lowercase)
- [x] Unicode characters (XOR works with any char)

## Solution Code

```java
// Language: Java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            result ^= s.charAt(i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            result ^= t.charAt(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Alternative Approaches
- **Frequency Counting:** Use array/HashMap to count character frequencies O(n) space
- **Sorting:** Sort both strings and compare differences O(n log n) time
- **Sum Approach:** Sum ASCII values and find difference (risk of overflow)

## Personal Notes
Elegant XOR solution showcasing bit manipulation power. The key insight is that XOR naturally cancels out pairs, leaving only the unpaired element. This technique is commonly used in "find the different/missing element" problems.
