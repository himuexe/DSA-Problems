# Problem Note Template Usage Guide

## Quick Start
1. Copy `problem-note-template.md` for each new problem
2. Rename file to `problem-name.md`
3. Fill in all sections as you solve the problem
4. Use tags for easy searching later

## Section Guidelines

### Header Information
- **Source:** AC (Apna College) or Kunal
- **Topic:** Arrays, LinkedList, Trees, etc.
- **Difficulty:** Easy/Medium/Hard (based on your perception)
- **Date Solved:** Today's date when you first solve it
- **Revision Due:** Use spaced repetition (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)
- **Status:** Solved → Reviewing → Mastered

### Problem Statement
- Keep it brief but complete
- Include key constraints
- Don't copy entire problem text, just essence

### Intuition/Approach
- **Most Important Section:** Your thought process
- Write this immediately after understanding the problem
- Include why you chose this approach over others

### Key Observations
- Patterns you noticed
- Critical insights that led to solution
- "Aha!" moments

### Algorithm Steps
- Clear, numbered steps
- Should be detailed enough that you can code from these steps alone
- Use consistent terminology

### Complexity Analysis
- Always include both time and space
- Provide justification for your analysis
- Consider best, average, and worst cases if different

### Edge Cases
- Use checkboxes to track what you've considered
- Add custom edge cases specific to the problem
- Think about boundary conditions

### Solution Code
- Include language name
- Add comments for non-obvious parts
- Keep code clean and readable

### Alternative Approaches
- Document other valid solutions
- Compare trade-offs (time vs space, readability vs performance)
- Note which approach you'd use in an interview

### Related Problems
- Link to similar problems across all resources
- Build connections between topics
- Help with pattern recognition

### Personal Notes
- Your struggles and breakthroughs
- Common mistakes you made
- Interview tips specific to this problem

### Revision History
- Track each review session
- Note your confidence level each time
- Identify areas that need more work

## Best Practices

### While Solving
1. **Fill as you go** - Don't leave it all for the end
2. **Be honest about difficulty** - Mark what YOU find hard
3. **Include mistakes** - Document wrong approaches and why they failed

### For Reviews
1. **Cover solution first** - Try to recall algorithm before looking
2. **Time yourself** - Can you solve it again quickly?
3. **Update revision due date** - Extend if mastered, shorten if struggling

### Organization Tips
1. **Use consistent naming** - `topic-problem-name.md`
2. **Update tags regularly** - Help with searching
3. **Link related problems** - Build a knowledge graph

## Spaced Repetition Schedule

**New Problem:**
- Solve today → Review in 1 day → 3 days → 1 week → 2 weeks → 1 month

**If you struggle during review:**
- Reset to 1 day interval

**If you master during review:**
- Double the interval

## File Naming Convention
- `arrays-two-sum.md`
- `linkedlist-reverse-list.md` 
- `trees-binary-search.md`
