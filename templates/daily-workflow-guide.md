3. **Check cross-reference** (`cross-reference/similar-problems.md`)
4. **Decide:** AC or Kunal version based on mapping

### Step 2: Set Up Problem File
1. **Copy template:** `cp templates/problem-note-template.md [destination]`

   - Test with examples
   - Verify edge cases

4. **Analyze**
   - Calculate time/space complexity
   - Document alternative approaches
   - Write personal insights

### Step 4: Complete Documentation
1. **Fill all sections** of the problem note
2. **Set revision date** (1 day from today for first review)

## üìÇ File Organization Tips

### Problem Files
- **Location:** Always in topic's `problems/` directory
- **Naming:** `topic-problem-name.md` (consistent, descriptive)
- **Linking:** Update README with problem links

### Quick Navigation
- **Bookmarks:** Keep key files bookmarked in editor
- **Recent files:** Use editor's recent files for quick access
- **Search:** Use file search for specific problems

### Backup Strategy
- **Git commits:** Regular commits after each problem
- **Descriptive messages:** "Solved: Arrays Two Sum problem"
- **Branch organization:** Consider topic branches for major sections

## ‚è∞ Time Management

### Recommended Time Blocks

#### Short Session (30-45 minutes)
- **5 min:** Daily startup routine
- **15 min:** Revision of due problems
- **20 min:** Work on one new problem
- **5 min:** Update tracking

#### Medium Session (60-90 minutes)
- **5 min:** Daily startup routine
- **20 min:** Revision of due problems
- **50 min:** Solve 1-2 new problems completely
- **10 min:** Update all tracking systems

#### Long Session (2-3 hours)
- **10 min:** Daily startup + planning
- **30 min:** Thorough revision session
- **90 min:** Solve 2-3 new problems with deep analysis
- **20 min:** Complete documentation and cross-referencing

### Break Management
- **Pomodoro technique:** 25 min work, 5 min break
- **Problem boundaries:** Don't break in middle of solving
- **Mental breaks:** Step away if stuck for 20+ minutes

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I'm Stuck on a Problem"
1. **Take a break:** 15-minute walk or different activity
2. **Review similar problems:** Check cross-reference document
3. **Simplify:** Try a smaller version of the problem
4. **Look for hints:** Check problem constraints for clues
5. **Time-box:** Don't spend more than 45 minutes stuck

### "I'm Behind on Revisions"
1. **Prioritize:** Do overdue problems first
2. **Batch review:** Quick review of multiple problems
3. **Adjust schedule:** Extend intervals if needed
4. **Focus:** Reduce new problems until caught up

### "My Notes Are Inconsistent"
1. **Template discipline:** Always use the template
2. **Regular cleanup:** Weekly review of note quality
3. **Learning from good examples:** Study well-documented problems
4. **Gradual improvement:** Focus on one section at a time

### "Progress Feels Slow"
1. **Adjust expectations:** Learning takes time
2. **Celebrate small wins:** Each problem solved is progress
3. **Review achievements:** Look at weekly/monthly progress
